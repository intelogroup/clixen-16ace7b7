# Security Checklist & Best Practices

This document outlines the security measures and checks required for the Clixen MVP.

## 1. OWASP Top 10 Considerations
- **Injection**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs before processing or storing.
- **Broken Authentication**: Enforce secure session management via Supabase Auth and rotate service keys as needed.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Never expose API keys on the client; use secure environment variables.
- **XXE / XSS**: Escape user-generated content in the UI; implement Content Security Policy (CSP).
- **Access Control**: Implement Row-Level Security (RLS) for all database tables.

## 2. HTTP Security Headers
- **CSP**: Define Content-Security-Policy to restrict scripts, styles, and frames.
- **HSTS**: Enforce HTTPS with Strict-Transport-Security header.
- **CORS**: Restrict API origins via CORS policy on Supabase Edge Functions.

## 3. Network & Infrastructure
- **TLS**: Ensure all services (Netlify, Supabase, n8n) are served over HTTPS.
- **Secret Management**: Use Netlify environment settings and Supabase secrets for production.

## 4. Penetration Testing & Scanning
- **Dependency Scanning**: Run Snyk or npm audit on CI to detect vulnerable dependencies.
- **Dynamic Scanning**: Schedule OWASP ZAP or similar scans against the staging deployment before each release.

## 5. Logging & Incident Response
- **Sentry Integration**: Capture frontend and backend exceptions; define alert thresholds.
- **Audit Logs**: Enable Supabase Audit Logs (if available) for sensitive table changes.

## 6. Compliance & Privacy
- **Data Retention**: Adhere to GDPR retention policies; implement data deletion requests.
- **User Consent**: Ensure analytics and tracking comply with privacy standards.
