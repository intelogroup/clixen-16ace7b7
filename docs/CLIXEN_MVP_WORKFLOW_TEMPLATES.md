## 🚀 Advanced Workflow Patterns

### **Pattern 1: The Parallel Processor**
```yaml
Use Case: Aggregate data from multiple sources simultaneously
Nodes: Schedule → Split → Multiple HTTP (parallel) → Merge → Code → SendGrid

Example: Daily competitive analysis
- Fetch data from 10 competitor sites in parallel
- Merge and analyze trends
- Generate executive report
```

### **Pattern 2: The Intelligent Router**
```yaml
Use Case: Complex decision trees with multiple outcomes
Nodes: Webhook → Code → Switch → Multiple branches → Merge

Example: Lead qualification and routing
- Score lead on 5 dimensions
- Route to 1 of 8 possible outcomes
- Each path has custom processing
```

### **Pattern 3: The Retry Machine**
```yaml
Use Case: Reliable processing with automatic retries
Nodes: Trigger → HTTP → Error Branch → Wait → Loop back

Example: Critical API calls
- Attempt API call
- On failure, wait with exponential backoff
- Retry up to 5 times
- Alert on final failure
```

### **Pattern 4: The Batch Optimizer**
```yaml
Use Case: Process large datasets efficiently
Nodes: Trigger → Split In Batches → Process → Aggregate → Next Batch

Example: Process 10,000 records
- Split into batches of 100
- Process each batch
- Aggregate results
- Continue until complete
```
