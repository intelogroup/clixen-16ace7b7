# 🚀 Clixen MVP: Quick Start Guide for Beta Users

**Go from Zero to Automated in 10 Minutes**

## 🎯 Welcome to Clixen Beta!

You're among the first 50 users to experience **enterprise-grade automation without the complexity**. This guide will have you building powerful workflows in minutes.

## ✨ What Makes Clixen Different

Unlike Zapier or Make, Clixen gives you:
- **Direct database access** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
- **IoT device control** (MQTT, sensors, smart devices)  
- **File management** (FTP, S3, backups)
- **Payment processing** (Stripe, PayPal)
- **AI intelligence** (OpenAI, Anthropic)

**All without managing OAuth tokens or API keys!**

## 🏃 Your First Workflow in 5 Minutes

### **Step 1: Choose a Template**

Pick one of these instant-value templates:

#### **Option A: "Price Drop Alert"**
Monitor any product and get notified when price drops
```
Schedule (every hour) → HTTP (check price) → IF (price < target) → Telegram (alert)
```

#### **Option B: "Daily Digest"**
Aggregate news and send morning summary
```
Schedule (7 AM) → RSS (fetch news) → OpenAI (summarize) → SendGrid (email)
```

#### **Option C: "Lead Enricher"**
Automatically qualify incoming leads
```
Webhook (form submission) → HTTP (enrich data) → Score → Email (notify sales)
```

### **Step 2: Natural Language Request**

Simply tell Clixen what you want:

```
"Every morning at 9 AM, check my competitors' prices 
and email me if anyone is cheaper than us"
```

### **Step 3: Deploy & Run**

Clixen will:
1. Generate the workflow
2. Configure the nodes
3. Deploy to n8n
4. Start automation immediately

**That's it! Your first automation is live.**
