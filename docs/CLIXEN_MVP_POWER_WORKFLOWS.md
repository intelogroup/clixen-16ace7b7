## 💡 Pro Implementation Tips

### **1. Database Optimization**
```sql
-- Use connection pooling for PostgreSQL
postgresql://user:pass@host/db?pool_max=10

-- Index frequently queried columns
CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email);

-- Use read replicas for analytics
postgresql://user:pass@read-replica/analytics
```

### **2. MQTT Best Practices**
```javascript
// Topic structure for multi-tenant
const topic = `client/${clientId}/device/${deviceId}/sensor/${sensorType}`;

// QoS levels for reliability
const qos = {
  0: "Fire and forget",
  1: "At least once",
  2: "Exactly once"
};
```

### **3. S3 Storage Patterns**
```javascript
// Organized bucket structure
const path = `${environment}/${date}/${category}/${filename}`;

// Lifecycle policies for cost optimization
const lifecycle = {
  transition_to_glacier: 30, // days
  expire: 365 // days
};
```
