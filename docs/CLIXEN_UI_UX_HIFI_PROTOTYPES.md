 # Clixen Hi‑Fi Mockups, Prototype & Token Export Plan

 Following the style guide and digital wireframes, this document outlines the deliverables and process for high-fidelity mockups, interactive prototype, and design tokens export.

 ## 1. High‑Fidelity Mockups

 **Deliverables**:
 - Desktop designs: Auth, Dashboard, Chat, Deployment screens.
 - Mobile designs: same screens optimized for responsive breakpoints.

 **Scope**:
 - Apply color palette, typography scale, iconography, and SVG logo.
 - Show all state variants: empty states, error/validation, loading, success/failure.
 - Annotate spacing, typography, and component behavior rules.

 **Resources**:
 - Base wireframes: `docs/CLIXEN_UI_UX_DIGITAL_WIREFRAMES.md`
 - Style guide: `docs/CLIXEN_UI_UX_STYLE_GUIDE.md`

 ## 2. Clickable Prototype

 **Goal**: Demonstrate core user flows in an interactive prototype environment (e.g., Figma Prototype).

 **Flows**:
 - Sign Up / Sign In → Project Dashboard → Create New Project → Chat → Deploy Workflow.
 - New Chat and view history interactions.
 - Deployment status transitions (pending → success / failure).

 **Output**:
 - Shared prototype link accessible to stakeholders and engineers.

 ## 3. Design Tokens & Assets Export

 **Tokens**:
 - Export color variables, typographic styles, spacing units, and icon size tokens in JSON or compatible format for engineering.

 **Assets**:
 - Provide optimized SVGs/PNGs for logo, icons, and any custom illustrations.

 **Delivery**:
 - Upload token files and assets to the repository under `docs/design-tokens/`.
 - Document usage instructions in `docs/CLIXEN_UI_UX_STYLE_GUIDE.md`.

 ## Next Steps
 - Upon completion, share all files and prototype link with the Senior Developer Engineer for technical feasibility and gap review.
 - Incorporate feedback and finalize deliverables for development handoff.
