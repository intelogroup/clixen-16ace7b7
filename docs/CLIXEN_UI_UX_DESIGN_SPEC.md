 # Clixen UI/UX & Product Design Specification

 This document defines the UI/UX and product design requirements for the Clixen MVP, following the BMAD framework to align with stakeholder goals and ensure a coherent design vision.

 ## 1. Business Goals
 - **Accelerate adoption**: Deliver an intuitive, minimalistic interface that reduces time-to-first-workflow and lowers the learning curve.
 - **Increase engagement**: Encourage exploration via persistent chat history, dashboard insights, and clear feedback loops.
 - **Ensure reliability**: Communicate system status (loading, errors, deployments) concisely to build user confidence.
 - **Enable growth**: Design extensible patterns for future features (multi-agent orchestration, collaboration) without disrupting the core UX.

 ## 2. Market & User Personas
 | Persona        | Goals                                         | UI/UX Implications                               |
 |----------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| New User       | Quick start, minimal setup                    | Onboarding flows, clear primary actions           |
| Power User     | Workflow management and monitoring            | Dashboard summaries, filtering, status badges     |
| Mobile Operator| Monitor and trigger flows on the go           | Responsive layout, touch targets, performance     |

 ## 3. Architecture & Key Features (Design Principles)
 ### 3.1 Design Principles
 - **Minimalism**: Surface only essential controls; leverage whitespace and clear typography.
 - **Consistency**: Reuse component patterns (buttons, cards, lists) across screens.
 - **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first layout, fluid grids, and breakpoints aligned to screenshot assets.
 - **Accessibility**: High-contrast colors, keyboard navigability, ARIA labels.

 ### 3.2 Core Screens & Components
 | Screen / Component    | Purpose                                         | Requirements                                       |
 |-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Auth Page**         | Sign up / Sign in                                | Email/password fields, inline error validation styling, swift feedback |
| **Project Dashboard** | List and select workflows and projects           | Card or table view with 'Create New Project' entry; project/workflow name, status, creation date; empty-state placeholder when no items; pagination or infinite scroll |
| **Chat Interface**    | Define workflows via natural language            | Chat bubbles, timestamped history, "New Chat" button, loading spinner; empty-state placeholder prompting to start a new conversation |
 | **Deployment Status** | Monitor workflow deployment                      | Inline status badges (pending, success, failure), retry action |
 | **Global Header**     | Navigation and user menu                         | Logo, project selector, profile menu, logout       |

 ### 3.3 Visual Style & Assets
 - **Screenshot References**: Leverage existing UI assets in `ui-test-results/` and `screenshots/` for spacing, typography, and component placement.
 - **Color Palette**: Align with brand; primary accent for actions (e.g., Chat "Send" button, Deploy), neutral backgrounds.
- **Logo**: Use the primary vector logo (`docs/clixen_logo.svg`) reflecting the node-graph motif.
- **Iconography**: Use consistent icon set (e.g., Status: ✔️ ❌ ⏳) for deployment feedback.

 ## 4. Delivery Plan (Design Roadmap)
 | Phase         | Deliverables                                            | Timeline  |
 |---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
 | **Wireframes**| Low-fidelity sketches for core screens (Auth, Dashboard, Chat, Status) | Week 1    |
 | **Hi-Fi Mockups**| High-fidelity visual comps incorporating branding, color, typography | Week 2    |
 | **Interactive Prototype**| Clickable prototype for key flows (signup→dashboard→chat→deploy) | Week 3    |
 | **Usability Testing**| 3–5 user sessions to validate core flows, collect feedback | Week 4    |
 | **Design Handoff**| Final assets, component specs (Figma/Sketch), design tokens, and redlines | Week 5    |
