## ðŸ¤– Multi-Agent System Performance

### Agent Response Quality
The Orchestrator agent demonstrated excellent performance:

```
User Request: "Create a simple workflow that sends a welcome email when a new user registers"

Agent Response:
âœ… Analyzed n8n capabilities
âœ… Identified missing "new user registration" trigger
âœ… Suggested practical alternatives:
   â€¢ Webhook trigger for registration events
   â€¢ Schedule trigger for batch processing
âœ… Asked clarifying questions for better solution
```

### Technical Integration
- **API Connectivity**: OpenAI GPT-4 integration working flawlessly
- **Database Integration**: Supabase connections established
- **Real-time Updates**: Agent progress displayed live in UI
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of capability limitations
