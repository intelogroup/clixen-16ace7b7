- **Network**: API rate limits vary by service
- **Storage**: Local knowledge graphs and caching

### Recommended Usage
1. **Start with Core MCPs**: Enable 15-20 essential servers first
2. **Add by Need**: Enable additional servers as specific capabilities are required
3. **Monitor Performance**: Track MCP server response times and resource usage
4. **API Budget Management**: Monitor usage costs for paid services

---

## Security and Compliance

### Best Practices
1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit API keys to version control
2. **Least Privilege**: Use minimal required permissions for each service
3. **Regular Rotation**: Rotate API keys and tokens regularly
4. **Network Security**: Use secure connections and validate certificates
5. **Audit Logging**: Enable logging for sensitive operations

### Data Privacy
- **GDPR Compliance**: Ensure MCP servers handle EU data appropriately
- **Data Retention**: Configure appropriate retention policies
- **User Consent**: Implement consent management for analytics services
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary data for operations

---

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Base Configuration**: Start with the 23 base MCP servers
2. **Obtain API Keys**: Secure necessary API keys for critical services
3. **Test Subagent Integration**: Validate each subagent works with assigned MCPs
4. **Implement Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for MCP server health and performance
5. **Scale Gradually**: Add enhanced MCP servers based on specific use cases

This enhanced MCP ecosystem provides comprehensive tooling coverage for the Clixen MVP while maintaining scalability for future growth.
