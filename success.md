## Replication Checklist

When starting new features:

1. âœ… Read MVP specifications first
2. âœ… Check VCT Framework compliance
3. âœ… Design with TypeScript interfaces
4. âœ… Implement error handling
5. âœ… Test across device sizes
6. âœ… Validate against security best practices
7. âœ… Build and test before committing
8. âœ… Update documentation appropriately

## Key Success Principles

1. **Follow specifications religiously**
2. **TypeScript first, JavaScript never**
3. **Error handling is not optional**
4. **Mobile responsive by design**
5. **Test early, test often**
6. **Security by default**
