## Replication Checklist

When starting new features:

1. ✅ Read MVP specifications first
2. ✅ Check VCT Framework compliance
3. ✅ Design with TypeScript interfaces
4. ✅ Implement error handling
5. ✅ Test across device sizes
6. ✅ Validate against security best practices
7. ✅ Build and test before committing
8. ✅ Update documentation appropriately

## Key Success Principles

1. **Follow specifications religiously**
2. **TypeScript first, JavaScript never**
3. **Error handling is not optional**
4. **Mobile responsive by design**
5. **Test early, test often**
6. **Security by default**
