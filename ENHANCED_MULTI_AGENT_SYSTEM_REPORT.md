- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Rollback Logging**: Detailed logging of rollback actions and success/failure

### 5. **Real Workflow Deployment Pipeline** âœ…
- **End-to-End Process**: Natural language â†’ AI design â†’ n8n JSON â†’ deployment â†’ activation
- **Webhook URL Generation**: Automatic extraction and provision of webhook endpoints  
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time health checks and performance metrics
- **Progress Tracking**: Live progress updates through all deployment phases
- **Production Ready**: Deployed workflows are immediately live and functional

- **Live deployment** with immediate activation and webhook URLs
- **Comprehensive validation** before deployment
- **Health monitoring** and performance metrics
- **Automatic rollback** on deployment failures
- **Real webhook endpoints** that users can immediately use
