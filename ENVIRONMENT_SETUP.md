# ðŸ”§ Environment Setup Guide

## OpenAI API Key Configuration

The OpenAI API key needs to be configured in multiple environments for the multi-agent system to work properly:

### 1. Local Development (.env)
Update your local `.env` file:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-openai-api-key-here
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-openai-api-key-here
```

### 2. Netlify Environment Variables
Set in Netlify dashboard under Site Settings > Environment Variables:
- `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` = your-actual-openai-api-key

### 3. Supabase Edge Functions (Already Set)
The Supabase edge functions secret has been configured:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` = configured via Supabase MCP

## Current API Key
The working OpenAI API key has been provided separately and should be set in the environment variables listed above.

## Security Note
The API key has been removed from the `.env` file in version control to comply with GitHub's push protection. You'll need to add it manually to your local environment.
