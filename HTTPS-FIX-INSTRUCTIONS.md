# 🔒 HTTPS Configuration Fix for Clixen Auth Issue

## ✅ Problem Diagnosed & Fixed

**Root Cause**: Mixed Content Security Issue
- Frontend: HTTP (http://18.221.12.50)  
- Supabase: HTTPS (https://zfbgdixbzezpxllkoyfc.supabase.co)
- Browser blocks HTTP→HTTPS requests for security

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. HTTPS Certificate & Configuration ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Self-signed SSL certificate created for 18.221.12.50
- ✅ Apache SSL virtual host configured
- ✅ Security headers added for Supabase integration
- ✅ HTTPS working locally on server

### 2. AWS Security Group Configuration ⚠️ REQUIRED

**Manual Step Required**: Open port 443 (HTTPS) in AWS Security Group

#### Via AWS Console:
1. Go to EC2 → Security Groups
2. Find security group for instance `18.221.12.50`
3. Add Inbound Rule:
   - Type: HTTPS
   - Protocol: TCP  
   - Port: 443
   - Source: 0.0.0.0/0 (or your IP range)

#### Via AWS CLI (if available):
```bash
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
  --group-id sg-xxxxxxxxx \
  --protocol tcp \
  --port 443 \
  --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```

### 3. Test HTTPS Access
After opening port 443:
```bash
curl -k https://18.221.12.50
```

## 🎯 Expected Result

After AWS security group update:
- ✅ Frontend accessible via: `https://18.221.12.50` 
- ✅ Mixed content security issue resolved
- ✅ Supabase authentication will work properly
- ✅ Browser can make HTTPS→HTTPS requests to Supabase

## 🔧 Verification Steps

1. **HTTPS Access**: `https://18.221.12.50` loads without connection refused
2. **Authentication Test**: Login/signup works in browser
3. **Mixed Content**: No security warnings in browser console
4. **Network**: Browser can reach Supabase API endpoints

## 📝 Current Status

- ✅ SSL Certificate: Configured
- ✅ Apache HTTPS: Configured  
- ✅ Security Headers: Configured
- ⚠️ AWS Security Group: **NEEDS PORT 443 OPENED**
- ⚠️ Supabase CORS: May need `https://18.221.12.50` added

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Open AWS port 443** (manual step required)
2. **Test HTTPS access** 
3. **Update Supabase CORS** to allow `https://18.221.12.50`
4. **Verify authentication** works in browser

---

**Result**: Authentication "Failed to fetch" error will be resolved once HTTPS is accessible from external traffic.
